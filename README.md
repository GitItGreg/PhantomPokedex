# PhantomPokedex
This is my very first funny little project using very basic html to make a clone of a Pokedex website
Here I mostly wanted to practice organizing a basic website with HTML and using some light CSS on the page as well.
Also wanted to link pages together by creating a responsive naviogation bar.
